## 2011（旅程之“余”）

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/05/Qyb7cdo9EU826Hg.png" alt="image-20211205215657242" style="zoom: 50%;" />

​	As is clearly shown in the picture above, sitting in the boat are two tourists, who are enjoying their trip but dropping litter into the lake. And below the picture, there is a caption which says: "The 'Left' of Travel".

​	Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the cartoon that the cartoonist intends to attract our attention to the issue of throwing litter casually. The primary cause of such behaviors is the lack of environmental awareness. They think that they are only tourists, who just enjoy their trip, but ignore that they also need to take the responsibility of protecting the environment as tourists. Were the situation to continue, we would pay a heavy price.

​	From the analyses made above, we may come to the conclusion that we should avoid similar behaviors. On the macro level, the government and the mass media need to shoulder their social responsibility to guide citizens' behavior. On the micro level, it is every individual's duty to improve awareness of protecting the environment, and timely stop others from throwing litter. With these measures taken, it is reasonable for us to believe that throwing litter casually will be solved in the future.

## 2012（不同的角度看问题）

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/11/rVUYiOKtH8Q36oT.png" alt="image-20211211221405302" style="zoom:50%;" />

​	

​	As is clearly shown in the picture above, two men show different attitudes when they see the bottle lying on the ground. One man puts his hand on his head, saying sadly that "It is all gone!" while the other saying happily that "Luckily, there is some left."

​	Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the cartoon that the cartoonist intends to attract our attention to the issue of different attitudes may lead to different results. If we are negative when we get into troubles, we may get lost and lose the courage to fight with the troubles. On the contrary, if we remain positive when we are faced with difficulties, we will finally overcome the difficulties.

​	From the analyses made above, we may come to the conclusion that we must be positive no matter what difficulties we are faced with. Only by being optimistic and working harder can we overcome the troubles and turn our dreams into reality.

## 2013（毕业选择）

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/14/O82GBqNlgTFkjiS.png" alt="image-20211214215441094" style="zoom: 50%;" />

​	As is clear shown in the picture above, many graduates are standing **at a fork in the road**.  They are faced with four different choices, including seeking for jobs, taking part in the postgraduate entrance exam, going abroad for studying and starting a business. And below the picture, there is a caption which says: "Make a choice".

​	Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the cartoon that the cartoonist intends to attract our attention to the issue of the choice after graduating. It is of vital importance to consider about our future development. First, We should learn about the advantages and disadvantages about each path. And then, it is important for us to take a full consideration about which way is the best for us. Consequently, we can make the final choice.

​	In my view, no matter which path we choose, it is necessary for us to make efforts. Only by working harder can we overcome the troubles and turn our dreams into reality.

## 2014（相携）

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/18/YzX1ctWVOngGITD.png" alt="image-20211218201705422" style="zoom:50%;" />

​	As is clearly shown above,  there are two pictures about a daughter and a mother. One was taken 30 years ago, showing that the young mother holding her daughter's hand. Another was taken recently, recording that the grown daughter supporting the old mother with sweet smile.

​	Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the cartoon that the cartoonist intends to attract our attention to the issue of the love between children and parents. With the improvement of living standards, many adults neglect the spiritual care for their parents. They think physical care is enough for the parents and paying more attention to the parents will reduce their quality of life. But they are not aware that taking care of their parents should be also a part of their life.

​	From the analyses made above, we may come to the conclusion that we should take the responsibility of looking after parents. Only by giving the priority to taking care of our parents can we enjoy our life better.
