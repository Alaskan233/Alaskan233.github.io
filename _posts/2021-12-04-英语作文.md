## 2011（旅程之“余”）

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/05/Qyb7cdo9EU826Hg.png" alt="image-20211205215657242" style="zoom: 50%;" />

​	As is clearly shown in the picture above, sitting in the boat are two tourists, who are enjoying their trip but dropping litter into the lake. And below the picture, there is a caption which says: "The 'Left' of Travel".

​	Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the cartoon that the cartoonist intends to attract our attention to the issue of throwing litter casually. The primary cause of such behaviors is the lack of environmental awareness. They think that they are only tourists, who just enjoy their trip, but ignore that they also need to take the responsibility of protecting the environment as tourists. Were the situation to continue, we would pay a heavy price.

​	From the analyses made above, we may come to the conclusion that we should avoid similar behaviors. On the macro level, the government and the mass media need to shoulder their social responsibility to guide citizens' behavior. On the micro level, it is every individual's duty to improve awareness of protecting the environment, and timely stop others from throwing litter. With these measures taken, it is reasonable for us to believe that throwing litter casually will be solved in the future.
