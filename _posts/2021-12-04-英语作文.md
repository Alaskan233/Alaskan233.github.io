Dear Amy，

​	I am very glad to hear that you are seeking for recommendations about movies. Learning that you are fond of animated movies, I am writing to recommend a movie called *The Little Prince*, which is one of my favorite.

​	The movie tells the adventurous experiences of the little prince from his planet to the earth. I love it for two reasons. ①**The first reason is that** the movie **features an interesting story** which won my heart. ②**Besides**, It is the little prince in the story that taught me to be honest, to love others, and to cherish the pureness of childhood.

​	I would be happy if you enjoy the movie, Looking forward to your early reply.

​																																																			You sincerely,

​																																																						Li Ming
